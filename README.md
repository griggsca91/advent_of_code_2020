# advent_of_code_2020

Advent of Code 2020 will be attempted in Ada this year.  I want to record my solutions to the problems, so I'll be using this repo. 

The decision to use Ada was made by a self imposed constraint of only using a language with 3 letters in the name.  So the following were really the only viable decision.

```
Ada
Lua
SQL
C++
APL
Elm
Nim
TCL
VBA
Awk
```

I almost chose SQL to see how long I would take to quit.
